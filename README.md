This repo is intended as a quick way to setup a development
environment for maintaining Slay the Spire.  It relies on
gradle's composite builds feature with git submodules to inject
the Java library artifact directly into the Slay the Spire AP Mod.
Open your IDE of choice in the repo root and it should load everything necessary,
at least as far as the Java side is concerned.
